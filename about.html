    <h1>Knows the CAPA Project </h1>
       <p> The CAPA Project (Animal Support and Protection Center) was created through Farah Service, current manager of Ciclovia do Rio Pinheiros and Parque Bruno Covas in São Paulo, in partnership with Mariana Aidar, businesswoman and animal activist. </p>

       <p>Through the CAPA Project, the animals of Ciclovia and Bruno Covas Park are assisted and cared for.
        We monitor all domestic and wild animals that live or appear on the bike path and in the park, providing all support and care when necessary.</p>
        <p>Domestic animals are rescued, treated and made available for adoption with disclosure through our Instagram @projeto.capa
          Wild animals are treated and released into the wild again.
          
          We do weekly monitoring of all groups of capybaras that live in these areas.
          There are 30 km of operation, with more than 10 groups of capybaras being monitored, totaling more than 110 individuals.
          
          We collected blood and tick samples from Capybaras to monitor spotted fever at the site.
          We have never had a spotted fever-transmitting tick on the banks of the Pinheiros River in SP!
          
          Note: We do not rescue animals outside our area of ​​operation!</p>
          
          <h1>Services Offered</h1>
          <p> Advice, design, management plan, survey and population control of Capybaras.
          Part of the value obtained from these services is used to care for the animals rescued by the NGO.</p>
